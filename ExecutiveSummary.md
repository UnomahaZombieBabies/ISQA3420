## Executive Summary

Our enterprise faces a challenge that many organizations face - that of managing open source software being leveraged by our organization. Our developers often use portions of code or entire codebases from external repositories such as GitHub or CodePlex. These assets have inherent risks, namely that of licensing and vulnerabilities that may expose the organization to attack.

We propose to design and develop a system to address those risks. This system will increase awareness of licensing requirements and vulnerabilities associated with leveraging such assets. This system will be designed in such a way that it does not dramatically increase project overhead for developers or managment because the system will be setup to automate the discovery process. This solution will leverage but NIST and FOSSology in its automated solution.
